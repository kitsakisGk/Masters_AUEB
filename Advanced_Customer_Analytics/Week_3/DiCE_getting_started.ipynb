        "# Quick introduction to generating counterfactual explanations using DiCE\n",
        "\n",
        "Exploring \"what-if\" scenarios is an important way to inspect a machine learning (ML) model. The DiCE library helps you to understand an ML model by generating \"what-if\" data points that lead to the desired model output. Formally, such \"what-if\" data points are known as *counterfactuals*, described by the following question:\n",
        "> Given that the model's output for input $x$ is $y$, what would be the output if input $x$ is changed to $x'$?\n",
        "\n",
        "The answer to the above question can be obtained by simply inputting $x'$ to the ML model. However, in many cases, we are interested in the reverse question: what changes to $x$ would lead to a desired change in model's output? When inspecting a classifier, for instance, we are often interested in knowing the changes to $x$ that will lead to a desired predicted class. For a regressor, we may be interested in the changes to $x$ that lead to a desired output range. Ideally, these changes should be *proximal* to bring out the local decision logic of the classifier, *sparse* to highlight a limited set of features, and *diverse* to show the different ways in which the same outcome can be achieved. The DiCE library provides an easy interface to generate such counterfactual examples for any ML model.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to proximity (minimal changes) and diversity, another important metric for counterfactual examples is their **feasibility**. If the changes in a counterfactual example are not feasible (e.g., outside the possible range of a particular feature), then the example is less useful. Specifying the possible ranges for continuous features (and possible values for categorical features) is one of the simplest forms of feasibility. DiCE allows you to customize the permitted values for features through the `permitted_range` parameter. In general, feasibility is a complex concept based on whether the [*changes* indicated by a counterfactual are feasible](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03277) for the individual, not just that certain values are feasible (e.g., 20 years may be a feasible value for Age feature, but changing a person's age from 22 to 20 is not feasible). DiCE will support such constraints in a future release.\n",
        "\n",
        "Counterfactual examples generated by DiCE are closely related to **necessity** and **sufficiency** conditions for causing a given model output. Necessity and sufficiency provide an intuitive way to explain a model's output. Given an input $x$ and the model output $y$, a feature value $x_i$ is *necessary* for causing the model output $y$ if changing $x_i$ changes the model output, while keeping every other feature constant. Similarly, a feature value $x_i$ is *sufficient* for causing the model output $y$ if it is impossible to change the model output while keeping $x_i$ constant. DiCE allows inspecting necessity and sufficiency by setting the `features_to_vary` parameter. If `features_to_vary` is set to $x_i$, then the generated counterfactuals demonstrate the necessity of the feature. If `features_to_vary` is set to all features except $x_i$, then the absence of any counterfactuals demonstrates the sufficiency of the feature. In practice, a single feature may be neither sufficient nor necessary---the formal definitions and the `features_to_vary` parameter translate easily to sets of features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the counterfactuals for an input data point can be used to derive a **local importance score** for each feature. The local feature importance score ranks features by their frequency of being changed in the generated counterfactuals. Among all the features, necessary features are likely to be changed more often to generate proximal counterfactuals and therefore will receive a higher score. You can use `features_to_vary` and `permitted_range` parameteres to refine the search space for the counterfactuals and consequently, the local importance score. Given a set of input points, the local importance score can be aggregated to provide a global importance score. Compared to explanation methods like LIME or SHAP, feature importance scores generated by DiCE tend to give importance to a larger number of features; more details are in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04917).\n",
        "\n",
        "To generate counterfactuals, DiCE implements two kinds of methods: model-agnostic and gradient-based.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Model-Agnostic**: These methods apply to any black-box classifier or regressor. They are based on sampling nearby points to an input point, while optimizing a loss function based on proximity (and optionally, sparsity, diversity and feasibility). Use this class of methods for sklearn models. Currently supported methods are:\n",
        "    * Randomized Search\n",
        "    * Genetic Search\n",
        "    * KD Tree Search (for counterfactuals from a given training dataset)\n",
        "* **Gradient-Based**: These methods apply to differentiable models, such as those returned by deep learning libraries like tensorflow and pytorch. They are based on an explicit loss minimization based on proximity, diversity and feasibility. The method is described in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07697).\n",
        "\n",
        "![DiCE API](images/dice_getting_started_api.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "DiCE requires two inputs: a training dataset and a pre-trained ML model. When the training dataset is unknown (e.g., for privacy reasons), it can also work without access to the full dataset (see this [notebook](DiCE_with_private_data.ipynb) for an example). Below we show a simple example."
