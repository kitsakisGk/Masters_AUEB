[2025-2026 PT] Project I
Περιγραφή

Data refer to Pisa competition 2018.
The data can be seen in the attached R workspace
see also https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/2018database/
I have extracted part of the data for convenience.

The scope of the project is to use the data (and perhaps any other relevant and useful data)
to study
- the position of Greece within the participating countries
- the gender gap in different countries

You have to deliver
- A presentation (powerpoint or pdf) with at least 10 static visualizations, preferably in R but you
can also use Pyhton,
to study the data and create your opinion about the topic in a
full and convincing manner. No interactive plots can be produced in this part.
The presentation must be self-contained: suppose that you will present
it in front of an audience of mixed knowledge on the topic.
- at least 2 interactive plots using Tableau or R-shiny (or similar Python library) and a short presentation
(powerpoint or pdf) explaining the interactive capabilities that you offer.
- The R/Python code, Tableau files and data files needed to generate all the plots.

For grading we will consider
the correctness
the variety
the originality
the execution
the presentation
of your plots

Deadline: 7/12/2025
