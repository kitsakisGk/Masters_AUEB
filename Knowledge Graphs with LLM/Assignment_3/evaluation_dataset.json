    "text": "UCI Health has become the first Southern California health system to deploy photon-counting computed tomography technology. The groundbreaking equipment was installed at the Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center and Ambulatory Care building at UCI Health — Irvine, with initial patient scans beginning July 16, 2024. According to Dr. Vahid Yaghmai, chair of radiological sciences, this technology enables clinicians to evaluate the body with very high-resolution images obtained in less than a second, compared to much longer studies performed with conventional scanners. The scanner serves multiple specialties within UCI Health's comprehensive cancer center, including oncology, neurosciences, digestive health, and orthopedic services.",

    "text": "Northwestern Medical Center in St. Albans is replacing its CT equipment this summer with a new Canon system. The current scanner, installed in 2011 and upgraded in 2015, will be replaced after approximately two months of construction. The Diagnostic Imaging department will operate a mobile CT unit during construction to maintain uninterrupted patient services. The upgrade includes expanding the CT suite, adding two triage rooms, and creating additional waiting space. The new system offers faster imaging speeds, enhanced image quality, and advanced software capabilities. Features include dose reduction technology and metal artifact reduction. The equipment supports fluoroscopy-guided procedures.",
